# Crystal-Clash

**Crystal Clash** is a fully interactive and immersive AR (Augmented Reality) game built for Android users. Players can set up their base castle in the real-world environment using AR, and build defensive towers to protect the castle from waves of enemies. As the game progresses, players earn rewards and upgrades to strengthen their defenses.

## Game Concept

Crystal Clash brings the excitement of a tower defense game into the real world through Augmented Reality. The player’s mission is to protect their main castle tower from incoming enemies by strategically building support towers and directly controlling the main tower to defeat enemies.

### Key Features:

- **AR Environment Setup**: The player scans their surroundings to place the main castle tower at the center of the battlefield.
- **Main Tower**: Controlled by the player, the main tower can aim and shoot enemies by tapping the screen. It serves as the player's primary defense.
- **Support Towers**: The player can buy and place 4 different types of support towers to help destroy enemies:
  - **Normal Tower**: Basic defense tower.
  - **Fire Tower**: Shoots fire attacks to deal damage over time.
  - **Electric Tower**: Sends electric shocks to enemies.
  - **Freeze Tower**: Slows down enemies and reduces their attack speed.
- **Level Progression**: As the levels increase, more enemies appear with increasing difficulty. Each completed level rewards the player with points.
- **Upgrades**: Players can use earned points to buy health or shields for their main tower and upgrade support towers for better defense.
